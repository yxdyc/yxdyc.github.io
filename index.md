# Daoyuan Chen 
Hi there! I am currently a staff at Data Analytics and Intelligence Lab, Alibaba Tongyi. My interest largely lies in the research, systems, and their practical applications related to efficient Machine Learning, Federated Learning (FL), Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-modal Learning.

I've published over 30 technical papers, a number of which I've led as the first author and were presented at top-tier conferences such as ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, KDD, SIGMOD, ACL and SIGIR. In addition to this, I'm glad to have the opportunity to be founding/core contributor for several open-source projects, such as [Data-Juicer](https://github.com/alibaba/data-juicer) & [DJ-SORA](https://github.com/alibaba/data-juicer/blob/main/docs/DJ_SORA.md) (one-stop multi-modal data processing for LLMs), [FS-Real](https://github.com/alibaba/FederatedScope/tree/FSreal) (an enhanced system enables scalable cross-device FL on phones and cars), [pFL-Bench](https://github.com/alibaba/FederatedScope/tree/master/benchmark/pFL-Bench) (a comprehensive benchmark for personalized FL), [FederatedScope](https://github.com/alibaba/FederatedScope) (an easy-to-use FL platform) and [AgentScope](https://github.com/modelscope/agentscope) (a multi-agent LLM platform).

## Misc.
> Creativity is intelligence having fun.

When it comes to leisure, I enjoy basketball, photography, playing the guitar, and listening to music - R&B and hip-hop being my genre of choice.
