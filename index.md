# Daoyuan Chen 
Hi there! I am currently a staff at Alibaba DAMO Academy. My interest largely lies in the research, systems, and their practical applications related to efficient Machine Learning, Federated Learning (FL), and Large Language Models (LLMs).

I've published over 20 academic papers, a number of which I've led as the first author and were presented at top-tier conferences such as ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, KDD, SIGMOD and ACL. In addition to this, I'm glad to have the opportunity to be founding/core contributor for several open-source projects, such as [Data-Juicer](https://github.com/alibaba/data-juicer) (a data processing system for LLMs), [FS-Real](https://github.com/alibaba/FederatedScope/tree/FSreal) (an enhanced system enables scalable cross-device FL on phones and cars), [pFL-Bench](https://github.com/alibaba/FederatedScope/tree/master/benchmark/pFL-Bench) (a comprehensive benchmark for personalized FL), [FederatedScope](https://github.com/alibaba/FederatedScope) (an easy-to-use FL platform) and [AgentScope](https://github.com/modelscope/agentscope) (a multi-agent LLM platform).
